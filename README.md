# Exergaming
## Tele-rehabilitation software for MS Patients

Exergaming project is a game series developed to improve the treatment process of patients in need of rehabilitation. It includes motion capture based games thanks to the WebCam it uses. The movements of the users are captured by WebCam  and transferred to the Unity game engine. 

Unity, on the other hand, is responsible for all game logic and character object interactions except hardware-based motion capture. The game is planned to include an enhanced interior, lighting and animation package. It is a more realistic polished new version of the first version of the Exergaming game series developed in Python. 

### Projectâ€™s Scope and Target Audience
The aim of the project is to develop software for rehabilitation patients/disabled people to receive interactive physical therapy at home. Unity game engine and libraries will be used in software development. The software will enable patients doing physical therapy movements to perform physical movements by playing games. 

The games will be designed from a medical point of view by an expert group of doctors and physiotherapists. In the first stage, the games will be prepared only for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. Game scenarios will include scenarios for physical therapy of patients with upper extremity disability. 

### Motivation for Development of Exergaming
Today, there are many rehabilitation methods and they vary according to the specific needs of each patient. Rehabilitation becomes a long-term, hospital-controlled activity that sometimes takes months to years. Since it is not a very critical and definitive treatment, and it can be done with the individual's effort, not all hospital sessions are covered by the state in long-term treatment. Due to the above reasons, it is neglected by patients over time and eventually abandoned. \

In the scenarios prepared by the developer team, it is aimed to improve the treatment process of the patients with the gamification method. Unlike routine repetitive treatment methods, it is aimed to increase the active participation of the patients in the treatment and increase the efficiency. Each scenario provides the operation of special muscle and joint groups during the physical therapy of the patients.
